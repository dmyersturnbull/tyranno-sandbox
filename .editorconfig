# Strategy:
# We'll use the most prevalent indentation style for each language,
# using the survey of top-starred GitHub repos at https://ukupat.github.io/tabs-or-spaces/ .

# Line length:
# We'll generally specify 100 because it's a common choice.
# (I previously used 120 because it was Hatch's default, but almost no style guides recommend that.)
# Note that Prettier uses `max_line_length` as `--print-width`, which is a soft limit.
# That's a sensible approach, given that you can't always break lines.

# JavaScript, CSS, and many others -- as well as "unknown" file types.
# Use 2 spaces because it's the most common choice in the survey.
# Omit specifying `max_line_length` here because we'd need to unset it for things like CSV.
